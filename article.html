                Google is one of the world’s largest and most influential technology
                companies. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google
                started as a simple search engine with the mission to organize the
                world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.
                Over the years, Google has grown into a global tech giant offering
                products like Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Chrome, Android, and many more.

                The rise of Google began with its powerful PageRank algorithm,
                which delivered more relevant search results than any other search
                engine at the time. Today, Google handles billions of searches every
                single day, helping people find information instantly. From email
                services to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Google
                continues to innovate and shape the future of technology.
